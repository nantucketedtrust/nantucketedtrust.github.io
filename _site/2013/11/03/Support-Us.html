Incorporated as a not-for-profit entity with a 501(c)3 tax-exempt status, the Trust is able to receive financial gifts designated to benefit the students of the public school system, while the donors of such gifts qualify for appropriate tax deductions for their charitable contributions.  This is an ideal way for everyone who cares about Nantucket, year-round and seasonal residents, as well as businesses, to help ensure a promising future for the island’s most precious resource – its children.<br/></p>
