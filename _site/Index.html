    <h2><span class="no-bg">About Us</span></h2>
    <p>Founded in 1992, the Nantucket Education Trust is a non-profit community organization whose NETmission is three-fold: to generate private support for public education on Nantucket; to foster private and public partnerships that benefit the children of Nantucket Public Schools; and to honor excellence in teaching and learning.</p>

<p>The Trust was established during a time when school systems throughout the country were experiencing severe financial constraints as a result of newly imposed budget caps.  Often such restricted budgets covered only the basic necessities and essentials.  Several Nantucket community members had learned about how other towns were forming tax-exempt, non profit organizations to generate private money for the public schools from individuals, foundations and businesses.  A steering committee, consisting of school staff, parents and community members was formed.  Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Trust and the subsequent development of strategies to connect the public schools with the private sector.</p>

<p>The Trust, while connected to and supportive of the school system,  is autonomous, and has its own by-laws and Board of Directors.<br/><br/></p>

<section class="mission pannel" id="content2">
    <h2><span class="no-bg">Mission</span></h2>
    <p>Rooted in a community distinguished by its unique history and setting, Nantucket Education Trust pursues the following goals:
 <ul class="content-ul">
    <li>to enhance educational opportunities on Nantucket by mobilizing private sector resources and expertise;</li>
    <li>to foster alliances among business, community and school interests, and to serve as a catalyst for public and private partnerships that benefit education;</li>
    <li>to promote the exchange of ideas among island schools and between our schools and those from other communities;</li>
    <li>to support programs that honor excellence in teaching and learning;</li>
 </ul></p>

<p>Rather than duplicate the efforts of the island’s existing educational groups, including the public schools, Friends of the Nantucket Public Schools, the Community School, NISDA, the island’s private schools, and numerous voluntary activities, Nantucket Education Trust will seek new ways to support existing initiatives as well as explore strategies for promoting lasting, system-wide improvements.  The Trust will tap new sources that can assist teachers and students, and implement more effective school programs.</p>

    <h2><span class="no-bg">Programs</span></h2>
    <p>New program in the works:<br/><br/></p>

<h6>LITERARY EXCHANGE with AMERICAN SCHOOL OF LONDON</h6>

<p>The concept is to develop an exchange whereby our students in Honors and/or Advanced Placement English will spend 7-10 days in London working with the ASL staff reading a selection from the works of Shakespeare or Dickens.  In return, students from ASL will come to Nantucket at another time to work with our staff and community experts and organizations studying the works of Melville (or perhaps our own Nat Philbrick) and learn about the rich history of Nantucket.  In addition to the literary study,students will travel and experience what each locale has to offer.</p>

    <p>It’s going to take more than big ideas to educate our children.  We need to build a bridge between theory and reality and between policy and practice.  Supporting our district can help turn big ideas into reality and great schools.<br/></p>

Incorporated as a not-for-profit entity with a 501(c)3 tax-exempt status, the Trust is able to receive financial gifts designated to benefit the students of the public school system, while the donors of such gifts qualify for appropriate tax deductions for their charitable contributions.  This is an ideal way for everyone who cares about Nantucket, year-round and seasonal residents, as well as businesses, to help ensure a promising future for the island’s most precious resource – its children.<br/></p>

<section class="history pannel" id="content5">
    <h2><span class="no-bg">History of Program Support</span></h2>
    <p>What has the Trust funded in the past?<br /><br />
The Trust has always focused on the most pressing needs of the school system, above and beyond what is already covered in the school budget.  Past projects undertaken by the Trust include efforts to support excellence in teaching, such as underwriting staff travel and housing costs for off-island professional development, the first-ever on-island Woodrow Wilson Math Institute for Teachers, collaboration with the Princeton Alumni Association, a Texas Instruments Teachers’ Institute and a Community Service Learning Institute.
<br /><br />
Other projects the Trust has sponsored include:<br /><br /></p>

<ul class="content-ul">
    <li>Teacher Mini-Grants</li>
    <li>Special classroom and local history projects</li>
    <li>School plays and after school and summer programs for students</li>
    <li>Off-island experiences for students (French trip to Boston)</li>
    <li>Matching gifts to grant awards</li>
    <li>Challenge Grants to assist with Foundation applications</li>
    <li>Launching newer, unofficial sports such as soccer, lacrosse and ice hockey, all of which are now considered official sports with our Athletic program</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally, the Trust often serves as a pass through for many organizations that are part of the schools, such as the Community Network for Children, Nantucket Youth Hockey Club, and for events such as One Book One Island.</p>

<p>In the early years of the new millennium,  the Trust began an aggressive and pioneering project to develop a twelve-unit housing cluster.  Born out of the hard work of dedicated and tireless visionaries, Cow Pond Lane Apartments broke ground in May 2005, housing for school staff members which is located on property adjacent to the high school playing fields.  These units are at below market rental rates and provide an affordable housing option for our faculty and staff. Please visit <a href="http://housingnantucket.org">http://housingnantucket.org</a> for more information.</p>
