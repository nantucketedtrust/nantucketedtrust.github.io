    <h2><span>About Us</span></h2>
    <p>Founded in 1992, the Nantucket Education Trust (NET) is a non-profit community organization.  NET's mission is three-fold: to generate private support for public education on Nantucket; to foster private and public partnerships that benefit the children of Nantucket Public Schools; and to honor excellence in teaching and learning.</p>

<p>The Trust was established during a time when school systems throughout the country were experiencing severe financial constraints as a result of newly imposed budget caps.  Often such restricted budgets covered only the basic necessities and essentials.  Several Nantucket community members had learned about how other towns were forming tax-exempt, non profit organizations to generate private money for the public schools from individuals, foundations and businesses.  A steering committee, consisting of school staff, parents and community members was formed.  Their efforts resulted in the formation of the Trust and the subsequent development of strategies to connect the public schools with the private sector.</p>

<p>The Trust, while connected to and supportive of the school system, is autonomous, and has its own by-laws and Board of Directors.<br/><br/></p>

</section>

<section class="mission pannel" id="content2">
    <h2><span>Mission</span></h2>
    <p>Rooted in a community distinguished by its unique history and setting, Nantucket Education Trust pursues the following goals:</p>

<ul class="content-ul">
    <li>to enhance educational opportunities on Nantucket by mobilizing private sector resources and expertise;</li>
    <li>to foster alliances among business, community and school interests, and to serve as a catalyst for public and private partnerships that benefit education;</li>
    <li>to promote the exchange of ideas among island schools and between our schools and those from other communities;</li>
    <li>to support programs that honor excellence in teaching and learning;</li>
    </ul>


<p> Rather than duplicate the efforts of the island’s existing educational groups, including the public schools, Friends of the Nantucket Public Schools, the Community School, the island’s private schools, and numerous voluntary activities, Nantucket Education Trust will seek new ways to support existing initiatives as well as explore strategies for promoting lasting, system-wide improvements.  The Trust will tap new sources that can assist teachers and students, and implement more effective school programs.</p>

<section class="programs pannel" id="content3">
    <h2><span>Programs</span></h2>
    <h3><em>Current Programs:</em></h3>

<h4>SUMMER-BOOST KINDERGARTEN READINESS PROGRAM</h4>

<p>NET funded the transportation costs for Nantucket's youngest islanders. This gift decreased barriers to participation and ensured consistent attendance to this integral pre-kindergarten experience. Summer Boost is designed for children with limited exposure to academic skills including: letter and number recognition, language, fine and gross motor skills and pro-social activities.</p>

<h4>NANTUCKET SCALLOP RESEARCH INTERNSHIP PROJECT</h4>

<p>Researcher, Peter Boyce, under the direction of Maria Mitchell Association mentored three student interns to gather and analyze data collected regarding scallop propagation. NET supported this project by funding one exemplary student intern.</p>

<h4>GUEST SPEAKER NAVY SEAL RYAN PETERS</h4>

<p>NET, in collaboration with Egan Maritime Institute &amp; Nantucket Public Schools, invited all community members to hear Ryan Peters share his personal experience as a Navy Seal.</p>

<h4>HOLIDAY ON BROADWAY WITH LEAH HOCKING</h4>

<p>NET was excited to assist in bringing leading Broadway Vocalist, Leah Hocking, to Nantucket for a Holiday on Broadway performance with the Nantucket High School Choir - a once in a lifetime opportunity for many of our high school students.</p>

<h3><em>Proposed Programs:</em></h3>

<h4>LITERARY EXCHANGE with AMERICAN SCHOOL OF LONDON</h4>

<p>We plan to develop an exchange for Nantucket High School students in Honors and/or Advanced Placement English. They will spend 7-10 days in London working with the ASL staff reading a selection from the works of Shakespeare or Dickens.  In return, students from ASL will visit Nantucket at another time to work with NHS faculty, community experts and organizations to study Melville and other literary works while learning about the rich history of Nantucket.  In addition to the literary study, students will travel and experience what each locale has to offer.</p>

<p>INTERESTED IN COLLABORATING WITH NET?</p>

<p>The NET Board conducts monthly reviews on Project Proposals for mini grants up to $1,500. Grants will be awarded at higher levels as NET’s funding stream is increased through community support and private donations.</p>

<p>Please complete the Project Proposal form below to submit your application. Email any supporting documentation to NET board member, Caitlin Waddington, at waddingtonc@nps.k12.ma.us. Call 508-228-7285 x1162 for further information.</p>

<section class="support-us pannel" id="content4">
    <h2><span>Support Us</span></h2>
    <p>It’s going to take more than big ideas to educate our children.  We need to build a bridge between theory and reality and between policy and practice.  Supporting our district can help turn big ideas into reality and great schools.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Can anyone make a donation to the Trust?</span></p>

<p><a href="#" title="PayPal Donation Button" class="frontButton" id="payPalButton"><img src="/images/pay-pal-donate.png" alt="PayPal Button" /></a></p>

<p><span class="bold">YES!!!</span>
Incorporated as a not-for-profit entity with a 501(c)3 tax-exempt status, the Trust is able to receive financial gifts designated to benefit the students of the public school system, while the donors of such gifts qualify for appropriate tax deductions for their charitable contributions minus a 3% admistration fee. Donating is an ideal way for everyone who cares about Nantucket to help ensure a promising future for the island’s most precious resource – our children.</p>

<p>For more information, or if anyone wishes to make a donation, please contact NET Board member, Caitlin Waddington, 508-228-7285 x1162.</p>

<section class="history pannel" id="content5">
    <h2><span>History of Program Support</span></h2>
    <p>What has the Trust funded in the past?</p>

<p>The Trust has always focused on the most pressing needs of the school system, above and beyond what is already covered in the school budget.  Past projects undertaken by the Trust include efforts to support excellence in teaching, such as underwriting staff travel and housing costs for off-island professional development, the first-ever on-island Woodrow Wilson Math Institute for Teachers, collaboration with the Princeton Alumni Association, a Texas Instruments Teachers’ Institute and a Community Service Learning Institute.</p>

<p>Other projects the Trust has sponsored include:</p>

<ul class="content-ul">
    <li>Teacher Mini-Grants</li>
    <li>Special classroom and local history projects</li>
    <li>School plays, after school enrichment and summer programs for students</li>
    <li>Off-island experiences for students (French trip to Boston)</li>
    <li>Matching gifts to grant awards</li>
    <li>Challenge Grants to assist with Foundation applications</li>
    <li>Launching newer, unofficial sports such as soccer, lacrosse and ice hockey, all of which are now considered official sports with our Athletic program</li>
</ul>


<p>Additionally, the Trust often serves as a pass through for many organizations that are part of the schools, such as the Community Network for Children/Early Childhood Education, Nantucket Youth Hockey Club and for events such as One Book One Island.</p>

<p>In the early years of the new millennium, the Trust began an aggressive and pioneering project to develop a twelve-unit housing cluster.  Born out of the hard work of dedicated and tireless visionaries, Cow Pond Lane Apartments broke ground in May 2005, housing school staff members located on property neighboring the high school playing fields.  These residential units are offered at below market rental rates and provide affordable housing options for our faculty. Anyone interested in housing opportunities may contact our property site manager, Milen Tsvetkov, at  <a href="milen@housingnantucket.org">milen@housingnantucket.org</a>.</p>

<section class="strategy pannel" id="content6">
    <h2><span>Strategy</span></h2>
    <p>The Trust is committed to establishing a permanent endowment fund to be named in honor of Nina Chandler Murray.
Such an endowment will enable the Trust to continue funding supplemental initiatives needed to provide the students
of the Nantucket Public Schools with the quality education they deserve.  The goal is to raise $800,000 for the Nina
Chandler Murray Endowment.</p>
