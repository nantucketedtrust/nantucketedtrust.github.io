######HOLIDAY ON BROADWAY WITH LEAH HOCKING######
######LITERARY EXCHANGE with AMERICAN SCHOOL OF LONDON######
The concept is to develop an exchange whereby our students in Honors and/or Advanced Placement English will spend 7-10 days in London working with the ASL staff reading a selection from the works of Shakespeare or Dickens.  In return, students from ASL will come to Nantucket at another time to work with our staff and community experts and organizations studying the works of Melville and learn about the rich history of Nantucket.  In addition to the literary study,students will travel and experience what each locale has to offer.
